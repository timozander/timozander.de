During the [enterJS conference 2023](https://enterjs.de/), I gave [my second conference talk](/talk/enterjs-astro-2023/) ever. I spoke with a lot of people how I got into speaking and what it was like for me to prepare. This resulted in the following 5 tips that I follow while developing a conference talk. I do not consider myself a _naturally gifted_ speaker, so careful preparation is my strategy. 

This article _does not_ focus on creating good content, but rather on the act of speaking itself. So here are my tips for that:

1. [Be careful when submitting your topic](#1-be-careful-when-submitting-your-topic)
2. [Craft good slides](#2-craft-good-slides)
3. [Find your personal style](#3-find-your-personal-style)
4. [Write a script](#4-write-a-script)
5. [Practice, practice, practice](#5-practice-practice-practice)

## 1. Be careful when submitting your topic

A lot of time passes between your topic submission and the actual talk. For my recent talk, only three months passed, but this can easily extend up to half a year. This causes several issues.

For once, you can lose interest in the topic. Especially when you present some new technology, 6 months are a long time. The project can take a turn you disagree with, your personal focus could shift -- or the technology could be dead by the time of the talk. Even though a part of this risk is inherent, I would recommend to only talk about things with **significant enough momentum**. In the JavaScript world, pay careful attention to how long some framework has been around and how it performs in the yearly questionnaires, such as the [State of JS](https:/stateofjs.com/) or [StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

If you have to submit an Abstract for your talk, don't make it too specific. Avoid talking about granular content points. Instead, paint a broader picture of what your audience will learn from your talk and which topics they will familiarize themselves with. This way, you have more flexibility when actually recreating and rehearsing the talk. You will definitely end up repeatedly dumping entire sections and redoing others, so this would create a discrepancy between what you promised and what you deliver. I strongly recommend to **not** change the Abstract after its submission. Often conference organizers will refuse to do so anyway and it is also unfair to future attendees. *Under-promise and over-deliver*, never the opposite.

## 2. Craft good slides

This topic is done to death, but here is my word of warning: If you include code in your presentation. **Make it big**. Really big, unreasonably big. And then make it even bigger. There is no easier way to fully lose your audience than talking about some tiny code snippet that no one can read. Besides, if you feel the need to put a big wall of code onto one slide, then this is a good warning sign that you should do some restructuring.

## 3. Find your personal style

You can find a lot of conference talks online that are extremely entertaining by themselves, regardless of your interest in their contents. Those speakers captivate their audiences -- they are funny, they are engaging, they are entertaining. But they are also not you. Keep in mind that _selection bias_ plays a big role here: The majority of *actual* conference talks do not have TED-level quality. They are not supposed to. They are supposed to be informative and interesting, but not necessarily entertaining. **And that is okay.**

There is nothing more awkward than speakers trying to force themselves to be funny by putting memes on their slides or by reading out an overwhelming amount of pre-scripted jokes. Especially when you are nervous, this will never work out. Instead, focus on your strengths. If you are a good storyteller, tell a story. If you are good at explaining complex topics in a structured and methodical way, then do that. And **if** you are good at making people laugh, make people laugh. But do not try to be someone you are not.


## 4. Write a script

Caution, heresy: I personally had good experiences with writing a fully fleshed-out script during an early part of your preparation. The key is to *not* write an essay or an article, but to choose a tone that you feel comfortable speaking in. A language that you would use to talk to an interested coworker about your topic. Consider the following example:

> I want to let that sink in for a moment, because we Developers are sometimes really spoiled by technological progress. We are not just talking about “red flower”-kind of prompts. But about specifics, about positioning, about adjectives, about cultural references. And the results look really amazing.

My advice is to use short sentences with a rather simple structure. Especially when I speak in German, I try to avoid situations where the prefix of a verb is moved to the end of the sentence (_“Darüber denke ich nach”_). You also see a light use of rhetorical devices, such as the enumeration. _Do not_ open a list of devices to use, but instead use them naturally. If you are not sure whether a sentence sounds natural, read it out loud (to a friend). If it sounds weird, it is weird.

My strategy is to **not** learn this script by heard. Instead, I read it a couple of times and then start transforming my main arguments into bullet points. If there is some particularly good simile or reference I wrote, then I keep them in my bullet points. The same applies to transitions between slides.

## 5. Practice, practice, practice

Once you have your slides and notes ready, start practicing. Since you most likely (if you are reading this) prepare for such a presentation _after_ your day job, start early. I usually start 1 – 2 months before with this practicing phase. Yes, this is excessive, but this allows me to regularly practice and not guilt-shame myself if life gets in the way of your schedule. 

In the beginning, you will naturally remember some parts of your script and follow them. However, with each iteration, a framework will develop, with some phrases being somewhat fixed every time you practice, and some gaps that you are able to spontaneously fill out. The key is to learn which gaps you can fill out proficiently and where it gets awkward.

When creating the presentation, you will also tremendously underestimate the time you need. Therefore, practicing will also put your timing on track, so that achieve a comfortable time that is within your requirements.

Similarly to [how I advocated for teaching](/blog/why-you-should-teach/), I strongly believe that speaking in “public” is beneficial in many ways. Especially smaller conferences are a good opportunity since the audience is often smaller. Alternatively, choose a specific niche that you are interested in that is not well-covered in conferences. Organizers are usually very welcoming about interesting submissions that are a little off the beaten track.
