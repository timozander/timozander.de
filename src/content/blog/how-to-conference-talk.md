During the [enterJS conference 2023](enterjs.de/), I held [my second conference talk](/talk/enterjs-astro-2023/) ever. TODO

I do not consider myself a _naturally gifted_ speaker, so careful preparation for the talk was key. That is why I want to share my process of preparing -- which things worked and what I would do differently next time.


## 1. Be careful when submitting your topic

A significant amount of times passes between your topic submission and the actual talk. In my case it was only three months, but this can easily extend up to half a year. This causes several issues.

For once, you can lose interest in the topic. Especially when your talk about some new technology, 6 months are a long time. The project can take a turn you disagree with, your personal focus could shift -- or the technology could be dead by the time of the talk. Even though a part of this risk is inherent, I would recommend to only talk about things with **significant enough momentum**. In the JavaScript world, pay careful attention to how long some framework has been around and how it performs in the yearly questionnaires, such as the [State of JS](https:/stateofjs.com/) or [StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

If you have to submit an Abstract for your talk, do not be too specific. Avoid talking about very specific content points, but rather paint a picture of what your audience will learn from this topic and which topics they will familiarize themselves with. This way, you have more flexibility when actually recreating and rehearsing the talk. You will definitely end up repeatedly dumping entire sections and redoing others. I strongly recommend to **not** change the Abstract after its submission. Often conference organizers will refuse to do so anyway, but it is also unfair to future attendees who might have read your original Abstract.

## 2. Find your personal style

You can find a lot of conference talks online that are extremely entertaining by themselves, regardless of your interest in their content. Those speakers capture their audience -- they are funny, they are engaging, they are entertaining. But they are also not you. Keep in mind that _selection bias_ plays a big role here: The majority of *actual* conference talks do not have TED-level quality. They are not supposed to. They are supposed to be informative and interesting, but not necessarily entertaining. **And that is okay.**

There is nothing more awkward than speakers trying to force themselves to be funny by putting memes on their slides or including an overwhelming amount of pre-scripted jokes in their speech. Especially when you are nervous, this will never work out. Instead, focus on your strengths. If you are a good storyteller, tell a story. If you are good at explaining complex topics in a structured and methodical way, then do that. And **if** you are good at making people laugh, make people laugh. But do not try to be someone you are not.


## 3. Write a script

This might sound heretical, but I personally had good experiences with writing a fully fleshed-out script during an early part of your preparation. The key is to *not* write an essay or an article, but to use a language that you feel comfortable speaking in. A language that you would use to talk to an interested coworker about your topic. Consider the following example:

> I want to let that sink in for a moment, because we Developers are sometimes really spoiled by technological progress. We are not just talking about “red flower”-kind of prompts. But about specifics, about positioning, about adjectives, about cultural references. And the results look really amazing.

This is an excerpt from a script I wrote.
