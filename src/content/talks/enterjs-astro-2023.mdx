I used [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) to create my slides, [you can download them here](https://github.com/timozander/astro-talk-enterjs/releases/latest)


## Source Code

You find the example project used on my Github: [timozander/astro-talk-enterjs-example](https://github.com/timozander/astro-talk-enterjs-example)

Note that the Git tags are used to show the different steps of the talk. Some of the coding examples might not have been shown, but are included in the repository.
