I am Timo Zander, a software developer from Cologne, Germany. I am currently working as a software engineer at [Barra Technologies](https://www.barrabytes.com/). My passion is to [write](/blog) about the JavaScript universe, technology and life in general. You find me regularly giving speeches at conferences and meetups, too!

Feel free to reach out to me on my socials or via [email](mailto:timo@timozander.de).
